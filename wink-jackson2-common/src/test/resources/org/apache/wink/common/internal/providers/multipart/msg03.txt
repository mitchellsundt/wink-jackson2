 Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST style web services. 
 The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces 
 a client runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink 
 will deliver component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of environments.
