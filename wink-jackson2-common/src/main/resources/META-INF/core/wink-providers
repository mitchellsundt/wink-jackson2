# The priority of the providers is the following:
#   1. Media Type: n/m > n/* > *.*
#   2. Priority property, if the provider was loaded by WinkApplication,
#      by default the priority is set to 0.5
#   3. Order of the providers. The later provider was added, the higher priority it has.
#      This means that if this file is added by a single Application, which occurs by default,
#      the later provider appears in this file, the higher priority it has.
